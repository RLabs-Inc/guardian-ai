# LLM-Directed Indexing Roadmap

## Document Purpose
This document outlines the roadmap for completing the LLM-directed indexing system in GuardianAI and connecting it to the Codebase Steward and Implementer Agent components.

## Current Status (May 2025)

We have successfully implemented the core Pattern Execution Framework with the following features:

1. **Flexible Relationship Mapping**
   - LLM can define any relationship types it finds in code
   - Robust error handling for missing location information
   - Schema-free approach preserves innovation potential

2. **Pattern-Based Chunking & Symbol Extraction**
   - Custom chunking strategies defined by the LLM
   - Multiple symbol extraction approaches
   - Adaptive to different codebases and languages

3. **JSON Response Handling**
   - Enhanced extraction and repair for truncated responses
   - Multiple fallback strategies
   - Graceful degradation for malformed JSON

4. **Vector Storage Integration**
   - ✅ Implemented using Vectra, a lightweight file-based vector database
   - ✅ Local storage for offline capability and simplicity
   - ✅ In-memory search for performance with disk persistence
   - ✅ Metadata filtering for targeted searches

5. **Embedding Generation**
   - ✅ Integrated with OpenAI embedding API
   - ✅ Caching system to reduce API calls
   - ✅ Batch processing for efficiency
   - ✅ Support for configurable models

6. **Vectorized Indexing Service**
   - ✅ Enhanced LLM-directed indexing with vector storage
   - ✅ Vector representations for code symbols
   - ✅ Vector representations for relationships
   - ✅ Semantic search capabilities

## Next Steps

### 1. Codebase Steward Implementation (3 weeks)

   - Create prompts for the Steward to analyze code patterns
   - Implement detection of coding standards and conventions
   - Generate "living standards" documentation based on analysis

3. **Contextual Knowledge Representation**
   - Design format for storing Steward's knowledge about codebase
   - Create system for updating knowledge as code changes
   - Implement prioritization for most relevant context

### 2. Steward-Implementer Communication (2 weeks)

1. **Communication Protocol**
   - Design message format between Steward and Implementer
   - Create structured format for implementation guidance
   - Implement context window management for large codebases

2. **Briefing Generation System**
   - Create prompts for generating implementation briefings
   - Implement relevance filtering for briefing content
   - Add code examples and pattern references to briefings

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Design mechanism for Implementer to request clarification
   - Create system for Steward to evaluate Implementer's output
   - Implement iterative refinement process

### 3. TUI Components & Task System (2 weeks)

1. **Task Management**
   - Create task definition interface
   - Implement task state tracking
   - Add task history and related operations

2. **Visualization Components**
   - Design codebase structure visualization
   - Create relationship graph display
   - Implement pattern highlighting

3. **Interactive Workflow**

   - Create "living standards" documentation system
   - Build contextual knowledge representation for guiding implementation

3. **Connect Steward and Implementer**
   - Design the communication protocol
   - Implement briefing generation
   - Create the feedback loop mechanism

4. **User Interface and Workflow**
   - Develop task management system
   - Build visualization components
   - Create interactive process for guiding implementation

## Technical Considerations

1. **LLM Provider Integration**
   - Ensure compatibility with Anthropic and OpenAI models
   - Implement token usage optimization
   - Add robust error handling for API failures

2. **Performance Optimization**
